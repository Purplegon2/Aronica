      "p": "The United Federal States of Lucithia (UFSL), commonly referred to as the United States (U.S.) or simply Lucithia, is a country primarily located in the continent of Lucithia, with one state situated in Western Enequit. It is a federal democratic councilocracy republic, consisting of 32 states, 30 of which are contiguous. The nation shares land borders with Ketan and Penequa, the latter of which borders New Penequa. The capital city is Nova City. The UFSL is a global superpower and maintains one of the largest economies on the planet Aron. It is a highly developed country, with a population exceeding 768 million, a GDP of $54.22 trillion USD, and a GDP per capita of more than $70,000 USD. It is known for its capitalist economy, technological innovation, and military strength, as well as its dominant cultural influence across Aron."

      "h2": "Etymology"
    },
    {
      "p": "The name Lucithia derives from a Lucithian root associated with “lands of light,” a term used by early settlers to describe the continent's broad plateaus and long daylight periods. The formal state name, United Federal States of Lucithia, was adopted at independence in 1675 to emphasize a union of semi-autonomous states under a federal councilocratic system. "

    {
      "p": "Before independence, the territory that would become the UFSL developed as a key colony within the Oytarian Empire during the Empire's apex in the 15th-16th centuries DME. Oytaria's continental holdings expanded across Kifahn and into Enequit, with Lucithia becoming one of its most valuable overseas territories. "

    },
    {
      "p": "The UFSL declared independence from the Oytarian Empire on May 5, 1675 DME, inaugurating a federal democratic councilocracy republic. The successful revolt accelerated the Empire's long decline as additional colonies followed Lucithia's example in subsequent decades. "

    {
      "p": "Following independence, Lucithia consolidated control over interior territories and established new states as migration and commerce expanded. Early industrialization accelerated after Sir Kolushev Riokiv's steam-engine breakthrough of 1662, which catalyzed manufacturing, rail, and maritime growth across the federation. "

      "p": "The First World War on Aron (1910-1914 DME) destabilized Enequit, culminating in the collapse of Aquita's wartime government. In 1939 DME, after Glaria bombed a UFSL harbor, Lucithia entered the Second World War; hostilities ended in 1949 when the UFSL used the final nuclear strike against Antara. In the postwar settlement, the UFSL and the Collected Communist Republics (CCR) emerged as rival superpowers. "

      "p": "The UFSL launched Pioneer-1, the first satellite, in 1955 DME, and achieved the first crewed landing on Nyx in 1966 (Lucithia 11, astronaut Brian Williams). These milestones cemented its technological lead even as the UFSL-CCR rivalry defined geopolitics. The CCR ultimately dissolved in 1996, leaving the UFSL the predominant global power. "

Executive authority is vested in a tripartite council currently comprising Robert Miller, Jennifer Brown, and Steve Sharm, each representing distinct political blocs and regions. The legislature is bicameral, with a Federal Council representing state governments and a proportionally elected National Assembly. Constitutional review is exercised by the Supreme Constitutional Court."

Extensive river systems connect interior agricultural basins to oceanic ports. The Western Enequit state secures transoceanic links to major trade partners. "
